## a simple notes app

The app uses the experimental metro bundler for web but seems to be working well with web and iOS so far (not yet tested on Android)

Use the following console commands to run the application locally:

```
npm install
npx expo start
```

Or try this [snack](https://snack.expo.dev/@mdpolky/postems) to play around with the iOS version of the app
