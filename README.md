## a simple notes app

The app uses the experimental metro bundler for web but seems to be working well with web and iOS so far (not yet tested on Android).

Use the following console commands to run the application locally:

```
npm install
npx expo start
```

This app is built with expo sdk 49+ so for the best experience it's recommended to play around with it locally, but if for some reason you cannot please try this [snack](https://snack.expo.dev/@mdpolky/postems) to get a feel of the iOS version of the app.
